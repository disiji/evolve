# evolve

In this project, we aim at using a fixed number of polygons with a fixed number of vertices to approximate a given image. For each polygon, the position of each vertex, RGBA of the shape need to be decided. Previous work to solve this problem used the random search method, i.e., to randomly modify one polygon each time, and then decide whether to accept the modification by calculating the change of fitness introduced by the it, where fitness is defined to be the distance between the result and the original image. We used three different methods, including gradient descent, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithm, to improve the performance. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of different algorithms. Results show that gradient descent works best among all the algorithms.

Our work is based on Roger Alsingâ€™s excellent idea(http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/ genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/), and the implementation http://alteredqualia. com/visualization/evolve/ by alteredq. The algorithm they used to select polygons is basically random search. Different methods, including gradient descent, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm are used to improve the performance, in terms of both running time and fitness.
